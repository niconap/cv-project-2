I wasn't happy with the way my first cv-project looked and worked and I also didn't like how messy and buggy the code was, so I decided to redo the project! This is the first time I also used bootstrap, I really liked the way it looked and how easy it is to use!

Skills shown in this project:

- Using React.js to create a webapp
- Using props and state in React.js
- Using bootstrap and css to style a webpage
- Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a webpage
